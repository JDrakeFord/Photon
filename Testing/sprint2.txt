The splash screen displays while the program opens and is closed
when the player entry screen loads. This program has been tested
to ensure that players and their codenames are copied to the database.
Player names can be composed of strings, numbers, and include spaces.
When the player entry screen is blank and a player is stored in the database,
the program will query the database once the names are filled in and autofill
the player's codename.
